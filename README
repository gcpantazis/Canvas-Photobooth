Current Status:

This project is using the isightcapture script to access and save a photo from an OSX webcam (attached to the system functioning as the server).

To do:

Create a canvas view to take 3-4 snapshots, stitch them together, then save the composition back to the server. If internet connection is available, each saved strip will then be posted to a predefined Flickr account.

Figure out how to execute bash script from PHP without sudoing.
